# Media Maestro - Media Organizer

This is a local-first media organizer application that helps you organize your photos and videos into a structured directory format.

## Key Features

- **Local First & Safe**: All file operations happen directly in your browser. Your files are never uploaded to a server. The application follows a strict **copy-only** policy, meaning your original files are never moved or deleted.
- **In-Browser Execution**: Run the entire organization process in your browser with features like pause, resume, and cancellation. The application automatically saves your progress and allows you to resume an incomplete session even after reloading the page.
- **Customizable Organization**: Define your own directory structure using placeholders like `{YYYY}` for year and `{MM}` for month.
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview the file operations before executing them to ensure everything is correct.

## Safety

This application is designed with safety in mind. **It never deletes your source files.** All operations are copy-only. After you have verified that your files have been organized correctly in the destination folder, you can manually delete the source files.

## CLI Usage

For users who prefer to run the organization process outside the browser, a companion Command-Line Interface (CLI) is available in the `media-organizer-cli` directory. It is designed to execute plans generated by the web UI with high performance and additional features like file verification and concurrent operations.

> **Important:** The CLI now requires both `--source-root` and `--dest-root` so it can resolve relative paths from the plan. These flags must point to the actual source and destination directories on your filesystem.

For detailed instructions on installation and usage, please refer to the [CLI's README file](./media-organizer-cli/README.md).

## Architecture and Development

This application is built with Next.js (App Router) and uses Zustand for global state management. All hashing (SHA-256/pHash) and metadata extraction tasks are delegated to a pool of Web Workers so the UI stays responsive, even when scanning tens of thousands of files.

For a detailed analysis of the project's structure, key components, and a summary of recent refactoring efforts, please see the [Architecture Review](./docs/architecture-review.md) document.

## Testing

This project uses a Jest-like environment for unit tests. Test files (`*.spec.ts`) are located alongside the features they test (e.g., in `__tests__` subdirectories) or in the top-level `/tests` directory.

For an example of how business logic is tested, see the test suite for the core planning logic at `src/features/plan/__tests__/plan-builder.spec.ts`.

Note: The `package.json` file does not contain a `test` script, so running the tests may require a specific local setup or direct invocation of a test runner like Jest or Vitest.

## MediaInfo WASM Handling
MediaInfo WASM is served from `/public/mediainfo`. It is copied on `postinstall` and initialized in the browser with `locateFile()`.
